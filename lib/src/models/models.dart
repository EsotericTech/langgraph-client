/// This library contains all the data models used to interact with the
/// LangGraph API, including:
/// - [Assistant]: Configurable instance of a graph for processing messages
/// - [Thread]: Container for state and message history
/// - [Run]: Execution instance of a graph on a thread
/// - [Command]: Special instructions for a run
/// - [Config]: Configuration options for runs
/// - [Cron]: Scheduled background task
///
/// These models correspond to the entities in the LangGraph API and are used
/// by the client to serialize and deserialize request and response data.
